# Image-Contest
This project is done in the process of learning the basics of server side (Node.js) in a full-stack course.

The main idea:
  everyone can add new images (by URL) to the images stock. by clicking on a button, the user can see all the images uploaded by him and others.
  the user can rate each image (1-5 stars) and then submit his vote. the page will show the images sorted by all users' raiting. 
  the user can vote only one time.

Notes:
  there is no database. the images and the votes are saved to the server.
  the app can be reviewed here: https://image-contest-full-stack.herokuapp.com/

Technologies:
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js.
  HTTP get and post requests. 
  Express Node web framework.
  body-parser - Node.js body parsing middleware.
  localStorage variable to remeber the user.
  deployed using Heroku.
